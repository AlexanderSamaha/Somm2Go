# 2XB3-Final

There is a place holder file in bin folder. Its just there so the bin folder can be uploaded succussfully with GitHub. Delete it once there is anything else in there.\
The three database is under the data folder inside the project.\
This branch is setup such that you need to have the latest version before you push to it (pull before push).\
While working with this, make sure to comment it (with JavaDoc), otherwise it will not be accepted for testing and merge to master branch.
