# 2XB3-Final

The three database is under the data folder inside the project (the 150k one is the only one being used currently, other two as a backup in this branch).\
The master branch and WiP-master branch is setup such that you cannot commit and push to it. When working, create a new branch from WiP-master and work from there. When finishes working, create a pull request to merge into WiP-master, and admine will approve the pull request.\
The master branch is used to store classes that are functioning properly and completely done only.\
The WiP-master branch is used to store classes at the last "checkpoint".\
While working with this, make sure to comment it (with JavaDoc), otherwise it will not be accepted for testing and merging to master or WiP-master branch.
